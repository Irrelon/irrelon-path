# Contribution Guidelines
All contributions, questions and suggestions are welcome and much appreciated. Spending the time to help improve a module is a really great thing :)

It's usually a good idea to open an issue around the idea or change you have before jumping into the code to do it in a PR because it might not gel with the ethos of the module.

If you do make a PR, please ensure that all tests pass and that you have written tests that cover your change if there aren't any already or the coverage would be poor from existing tests.
